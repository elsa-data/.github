Elsa Data is a software stack that provides data custodians and researchers with a collaborative space in which they can manage the sharing and access to genomic data sets.

Elsa Data can ingest approved applications from a variety of sources (REMS, RedCap, manual) and then creates a shared "release" - a specific web portal area documenting
the details of exactly what data is being shared with exactly which users and under what circumstances. Elsa Data then enables point
and click mechanics to actually release the genomic objects (object signing, copy out, access points). All of this sharing activity is strongly audited.

Elsa Data is distributed as a configurable Docker image (see [releases](https://github.com/elsa-data/elsa-data/pkgs/container/elsa-data)).
We also provide repositories demonstrating the
deployment of a complete Elsa Data suite (software + database) in
both [AWS](https://github.com/elsa-data/aws-application) and [Google Cloud](https://github.com/elsa-data/gcp-deploy).

Elsa Data is still work in progress - so we have no formal contribution guidelines yet. Contact the authors I guess!
